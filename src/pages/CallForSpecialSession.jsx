                Special Session Organisation
              </h2>
              <p className='pb-2'>Once approved, the Organizers will publicize the Special Session among researchers and practitioners in the field and attract a sufficient number of papers. Papers submitted to special sessions will undergo the same review process as regular papers. The special session organizers of the respective special session are responsible for organizing the review process, assuring at least three reviews per paper. This includes selection of reviewers from their peers.</p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                <li><span className='font-bold mr-1'>Benefits:</span>
                  At least one organizer of the successful Special Sessions is expected to register for and attend the conference, as well as chair of the corresponding sessions. One complimentary full registration will be provided to successful Special Sessions for every 8 papers not authored by any of the organizers.
                </li>
                <li><span className='font-bold mr-1'>Conflict of Interest:</span>
                  Before starting the review process, SS organizers must explicitly declare papers which present a conflict of interest for them. A conflict of interest arises where the judgement of a paper quality can be influenced by the organizers being authors or knowing some of the authors. To ensure independent reviews, this conflict must be marked as such in the submission system and the SS Co-Chairs notified so that they can arrange the review process.
                </li>
                <li><span className='font-bold mr-1'>Restrictions:</span>
                  During the review process, Special Session Organizers must take into account that: (1) An individual cannot be (co-) author of more than two papers submitted to the same Special Session. (2) Papers from organizers cannot exceed 60% of the contents of the Special Session.
                </li>
                <li><span className='font-bold mr-1'>Session Chairs:</span>
                  When a SS is finally accepted by the conference, SS organizers will serve as Session chairs in the conference. In some extenuated circumstance, Technical Program chairs and Conference General Chairs might take up the full control of appointing the Session Chairs, should the SS organizers be unable to participate in the conference.
